# `@lody/components` source guidelines

Parent `AGENTS.md` files also apply.

## Lightweight hosted entries

- Public/auth entry points that bypass the full product router import route-agnostic
  surfaces. Keep host navigation behind callback props so those surfaces do not import
  the route tree, `RuntimeProvider`, or workspace Flock document implementation. When
  an auth transition selects the destination, the host owns both the non-redirecting
  auth action and navigation so an auth helper cannot discard route-specific state.

## Keyboard navigation

- Each independently navigable list owns one `FocusScope` and one
  `useListKeyboardNavigation` call. Rows expose `data-scope-item` plus a stable
  `data-id`; Up/Down (and J/K) move only in the active scope, while the shell's
  single scope switcher uses Left/Right between visible leaf scopes. A local
  control may keep a key by calling `preventDefault`; text inputs are never
  intercepted. Nested parent scopes yield to their visible child scopes, and an
  open dialog's scopes never switch focus into the background workspace.

## Workspace transitions

- Authenticated workspace switches keep `MainLayout` mounted: the sidebar and
  workspace identity are stable chrome, while the content pane shows a scoped
  placeholder until route, runtime, and doc-meta ownership agree. Pending scope
  still fails closed — never retain the previous workspace's rows or `<Outlet />`
  content — and passes `workspaceReady={false}` so workspace-owned background work
  and the mobile workspace stack do not start early. The workspace identity's
  syncing state follows that same scoped readiness, not the coarser connection
  state; an online transport does not imply that workspace data is ready.
