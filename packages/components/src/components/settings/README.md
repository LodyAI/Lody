## Machine connection marks

`workspace-machine-accordion.tsx` renders the connection mark for collapsed and
expanded machine cards. An online machine keeps its solid green centre while
its halo expands and contracts at a constant speed over 2.8 seconds, using linear
CSS transform and opacity animation. Each direction takes 1.4 seconds.
Offline machines keep a static gray dot. Reduced motion keeps the online halo
static. Motion follows the existing `isOnline` value and adds no presence polling.

The [OnlineStatusMotion story](../../stories/DevicesDesktopLayout.stories.tsx)
uses the real machine card with a controlled online/offline value for inspection.
