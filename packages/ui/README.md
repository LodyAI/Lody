# `@lody/ui`

`@lody/ui` contains Lody's low-level visual primitives and semantic StyleX
tokens. Product surfaces compose these primitives through
`@lody/components`; the package does not contain product workflows or platform
behavior.

| Area                | Responsibility                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/tokens`        | Semantic color, type, spacing, motion, radius, and elevation tokens |
| `src/theme`         | Applies light or dark StyleX themes to a subtree                    |
| `src/button`        | Base UI Button behavior and Lody variants, sizes, tones, and shapes |
| `src/field`         | Base UI Field composition: label, Input, Textarea, Checkbox, Radio, Switch, help, and error |
| `src/gallery`       | The token board: every token and primitive state, in both palettes  |
| `stylex-options.ts` | Shared compiler configuration for source-consuming hosts            |

Consumers compile this package's source with `@stylexjs/unplugin` and its exported
StyleX options. Visual choices use component props. `className` is available for
layout and interaction constraints in product surfaces; it must not duplicate a
primitive's visual rules.

A field is a composition rather than one component: `Field.Root` owns the name,
the disabled flag and validity, and `Field.Label`, `Input`, `Textarea`,
`Checkbox`, `Radio`, `Switch`, `Field.Description` and `Field.Error` read that
state from it.

```tsx
<Field.Root name="title" invalid={!title}>
  <Field.Label>Session title</Field.Label>
  <Input placeholder="Describe the task" />
  <Field.Description>Shown in the sidebar.</Field.Description>
  <Field.Error match>Enter a title.</Field.Error>
</Field.Root>
```

`Checkbox`, `Radio` and `Switch` are the same well as a box: off is the well
rung, on is ink. Each renders a real `<button>` with Base UI's hidden input
beside it, so a `<label>` points at it and the family's `:disabled` and
`:focus-visible` rules reach it without a second mechanism.

```tsx
<Field.Label>
  <Checkbox name="notify" defaultChecked />
  Notify me when the session finishes
</Field.Label>
```

The state mapping every control in this family shares — rest, placeholder,
focus, invalid, disabled, checked, selected — is in
[token rules](src/tokens/RULES.md#fields).

The intended behavior is specified in [Shared UI primitives](../../specs/ui-primitives.md).
The integration decision is recorded in the
[UI Button migration takeover note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-08-ui-button-migration-takeover.md);
the field family and the Tailwind field concepts it replaces are recorded in the
[UI field primitives note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-09-09-ui-field-primitives.md).

Open the gallery with `pnpm storybook` and pick _Design System / UI Gallery_.
It renders each sample once per palette and reads its values back off the
rendered nodes, so a token that changes shows its new value there without the
board being edited. A new token or primitive state lands with its board entry;
`test/gallery.test.tsx` fails when a token has no entry.

Run `pnpm --filter @lody/ui typecheck` and `pnpm --filter @lody/ui test` after
changing a primitive or token.
